# Telco-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-regression-model
In this project I used a Logistic Regression modle to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company called Telco

**The main objective of this project was to:**

Identify key factors that drive churn.

Build a predictive model that predicts customer churn.

Provide insights that can help businesses improve customer retention.

**Dataset**

Telco Customer Churn dataset (publicly available on Kaggle).


**How I executed the project**

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Identified churn drivers through statistical analysis.

Preprocessed the data (Handled missing values, encoded features and standardised numerical features)

Split dataset into training and test sets.

Fitted the data into a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the performance of the model
