# Telco-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-regression-model
This project applies Logistic Regression to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn is one of the most pressing challenges for subscription-based businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

**Objective**

The main objective of this project was to:

Identify key factors that drive churn.

Build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer is likely to churn.

Provide insights that can help businesses improve customer retention.

**Dataset**

Telco Customer Churn dataset (publicly available on Kaggle).

Features included demographics, account information, and service usage.

**Methodology**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined distributions, correlations, and trends in customer behavior.

Identified churn drivers through statistical analysis.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical features (one-hot encoding).

Normalized/standardized numerical features.

**Model Building:**

Implemented Logistic Regression using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn.

Split dataset into training and test sets.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Evaluation & Insights:**

Assessed how well the model predicts churn.

Highlighted most important features contributing to churn.
